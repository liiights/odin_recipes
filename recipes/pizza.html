    <p>This Homemade Pepperoni Pizza has everything you want—a great crust, gooey cheese, and tons of pepperoni. The secret to great pepperoni flavor? Hide extra under the cheese! Who needs delivery?</p>

    <p>My kids love pizza, so pepperoni pizza is usually a surefire dinner win. But if I'm being honest, I rarely make pizza for my kids. I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery.

        So when I decided to make pizza at home, I knew it needed to be better than your average delivery. It needed tons of pepperoni, a nice crust, great flavor, and maybe even a surprise or two to put it over the top.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <p><em><strong>Quick Pizza Sauce</strong></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 (12oz) can CONTADINA Tomato Paste</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em><strong>Easy Pizza Crust</strong></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 & 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 oz) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups very warm water (120degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em><strong>Toppings</strong></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6oz) package HORMAEL Pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <strong><p>Step 1</p></strong>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
        <strong><p>Step 2</p></strong>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        <strong><p>Step 3</p></strong>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <strong><p>Step 4</p></strong>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <strong><p>Step 5</p></strong>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <strong><p>Step 6</p></strong>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
